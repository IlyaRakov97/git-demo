I wish I found some better sounds
No one's ever heard
I wish I had a better voice
That sang some better words
I wish I found some chords
In an order that is new
I wish I didn't have to rhyme
Every time I sang
I was told when I get older
All my fears would shrink
But now I'm insecure
And I care what people think
Wish we could turn back time
To the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep
But now we're stressed out
Wish we could turn back time
To the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep
But now we're stressed out
We're stressed out
Sometimes a certain smell will
Take me back to when I was young
How come I'm never able to identify
Where it's coming from?
I'd makeâ€¦

But now I'm insecure
And I care what people think

But now I'm insecure
And I care what people think
But now I'm insecure
And I care what people think
But now I'm insecure
And I care what people think
But now I'm insecure
And I care what people think
But now I'm insecure
And I care what people think
